# Minimalist-Browser

A browser truly worthy of being called minimalist.

Supports AI powered features with offline and online LLMs both.

Inspired by GNOME Web and Microsoft Edge.

For offline LLM use - https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile

From personal tests, LLaVa model gave the best compromise between answers and speed.

Steps to run ->
- Run - ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Run your llama file model or change API to point to something like OpenAI
- Run - ```python app.py```
- Enjoy the browser :)

Note: Use on Linux
